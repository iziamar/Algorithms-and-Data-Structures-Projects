How to compile and run program: 


To compile and run the FractalDrawer.java program either run it from your favorite IDE or compile the classes and run java FractalDrawer.java.


Assumptions:


We assume the user is fluent in python.


Additional features implemented:


The only additional feature implemented to this program is a while loop to check the validity of the user input for variable “shape”.


Known bugs:


Occasionally full fractal will not load from the canvas popup, but once the window is opened the full fractal will appear.

Idea: How to use colors in java, and the available color options.
